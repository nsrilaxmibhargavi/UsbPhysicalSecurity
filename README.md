# USB Security Manager  

## Overview  
The **USB Security Manager** is a powerful tool designed to **monitor, manage, and control USB storage access** to prevent unauthorized data transfers and security threats. This project enhances **data protection** by allowing users to enable, disable, or format USB storage devices dynamically.  

## Project Objectives  
The application provides administrators with the ability to:  
- Enable or disable USB storage access based on security policies.  
- Format USB devices securely to prevent data leaks.  
- Implement passkey verification to restrict unauthorized changes.  
- Use an intuitive **graphical interface** for seamless management.  

## Project Structure  
- **Main Application:** A user-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI** for USB security management.  
- **Core Features:** Includes USB enable/disable functionality, passkey protection, and device formatting.  
- **Resource Files:** Includes essential images and an **HTML-based documentation** file.  
- **Executable Version:** The project is compiled into an executable file for easy deployment.  

## Collaboration  
This project was developed collaboratively, where I focused on **UI/UX improvements and documentation using HTML**, while my team member worked on **backend logic using Python**.  

## Key Files  
- **main.py** – The primary Python script containing the logic and GUI.  
- **logo.jpg** – Application logo for branding.  
- **background.jpeg** – Background image for the interface.  
- **enable.jpg & disable.jpg** – Buttons for enabling/disabling USB access.  
- **ProjectDetails.html** – HTML documentation file.  
- **logo.ico** – Icon for the compiled application.  
- **Executable File (.exe)** – Standalone version for direct execution without dependencies.
